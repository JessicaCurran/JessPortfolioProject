I love creating and making things. <br> I have always enjoyed drawing and often experiment with different techniques. My other <br> biggest passion in life is cars. I gained a massive interest
    in cars a couple years ago and since then <br> have learned everything about them. Something that also takes up a lot of my time is my pc. I use this<br> every day to play video games, watch movies, and talk to my friends.</div> <h3 class="svelte-92jhd7">Future:</h3> <div id="line2" class="line2 svelte-92jhd7">At the moment, i am not completely sure what i want to do in the future. As i've always enjoyed being creative, i would love to work making or creating something. My goal when i 
        started this course was to become an animator but now i am not sure. Ive also always loved animals and would be interested in<br> potentially going into that field of work in the future.
        My main goal right now is to complete my course <br> and expand my skills even further.</div> <h4 class="svelte-92jhd7">Contact info:</h4> <div id="line3" class="line3 svelte-92jhd7">You can contact me by my college email @C00300855@setu.ie !</div> <div class="background svelte-92jhd7"></div> <img alt="art" class="art svelte-92jhd7"> <img alt="car" class="car svelte-92jhd7"> <img alt="pc" class="pc svelte-92jhd7"> <img alt="future" class="future svelte-92jhd7">`,1);function w(l){var s=g(),i=e(h(s),14);v(i,`background-image: url('${a??""}/cloud.jpg');`);var r=e(i,2);t(r,"src",`${a??""}/art.jpg`);var o=e(r,2);t(o,"src",`${a??""}/car.jpg`);var n=e(o,2);t(n,"src",`${a??""}/pc.jpg`);var d=e(n,2);t(d,"src",`${a??""}/future.jpg`),c(l,s)}export{w as component};
