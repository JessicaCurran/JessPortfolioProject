<h1>Jess' Site</h1>
<h2>Hello!</h2>
<h6>My name is Jess and this is my website. I am 21 and am currently studying <br> digital art and design. I have 
    always had a big passion for art and all things <br> creative. For most of my life i have done traditional drawings with pen and <br> paper but since starting this course, i've started exploring more digital art <br> which i would like to learn more and get better at.</h6>
<h7>Im not sure exactly what i would like to do in the future but i would love <br> to be involved with something creative and possibly art related.</h7>
    <h8> This is my website where i will showcase some of the work i have
         done <br> over the years including drawings, games and digital artwork. My most <br> prefered art style has always been on paper using lots of colour. 
        Since <br> starting this course, i have discovered and learned all about digital art <br> and have really enjoyed learning and experimenting with all of the <br>
    different ways to create digital art.</h8>
